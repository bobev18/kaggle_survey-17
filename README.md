# kaggle_survey-17
Jupyter Notebook exploring the 2017 survey dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017

Placeholder for few questions:
 * keeping errs and having execute all
 * column dependancy (asking how useful was a given tool after asking if the tool was used)
 * since ther is no demand for prediction -  just exploration - how to end that?
   * If I have shown the main problems with the data, do I need to process the entire set?
